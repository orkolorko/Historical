First of all, you need Cmake installed and working.
To compile the program you need PETSC 3.2, BOOST and MPFR for the Ulam version.
We avoided shipping the programs needing BOOST multiprecision, since 
it is still not so widespread.
Anyway, changing to BOOST-multiprecision is really simple (around 20 lines of code) 
we are going to publish a version using this library on one of our sites.

For the Lipschitz version you need the iRRAM library by Norbert-Mueller
version 2013-01.
Before compiling you have to set the enviroment variable
IRRAM_DIR to the installed directory of the iRRAM,
example: 
export IRRAM_DIR=/home/isaia/Dropbox/real/iRRAM_2013_01/installed

Once the set up is done run 
./cmake CMakeLists.txt
in the directory and the make all to make the programs.

For the Documentation, run
./doxygen config.doxy
